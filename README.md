# Google Sheets TimeStamp Script

This is a simple script implementation for google sheets where it will record date and time whenever a particular field is filled out. This can be an initial field or anything else that needs a timestamp whenever it is filled.

### How to run the script:
- Under 'Extensions' -> Select 'Apps Script'
- This will pull up a new window under the 'Project Editor'
- Copy Paste the following code from the source file into the project (you can delete the auto-generated 'myFunction' code block on the new project)
- Click on 'Deploy' -> 'New Deployment' -> Select type 'Web App' -> 'Deploy'
- Authorize the scripts access to your sheet data
